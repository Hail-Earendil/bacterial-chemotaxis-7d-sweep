# bacterial-chemotaxis-7d-sweep

Code and precomputed results for the paper:

**“Apparent Selection Pressure for Channel Capacity in *E. coli* Bacterial Chemotactic Sensor”**

This repository contains the Python script that runs a **7-dimensional parameter sweep** of an MWC-style receptor model, and exports the numerical outputs and figures used for analysis.

Running the script produces an output folder for a run, containing:
- A saved **`.npz` file** that contains the 7D sweep results
- **Logs** / warning summaries
- **Pair-wise R Coefficient**
- **Tables**
- **Line-Plots** (1D slices through the 7D sweep)
- **Heatmaps** (2D slices through the 7D sweep)
- **Full Panels** (grids of heatmaps)

The results from the script an be found in this link:
